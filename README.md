# Cryptocurrencies
Utilizing Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques to analyze cryptocurrency data 

## Overview
This project focuses on unsupervised machine learning to analyze data amongst cryptocurrency clients/markets. We focused on grouping the different currencies together to create a classification system for the new portfolio. 

## Analysis
First we had to look at the data and create a clean data table from which to work. This involved preprocessing the data for PCA. We originally had 1144 rows of data.

Then we were able to clean the data down to 532 rows of data. HVPlot Data

I ran into an issue with my code to pull the specific scatterplot visual. The ideal scenario would look like the image below.

I worked with a team member to pull the live 3D model for this dataset and we came up with the below visual.
